        In light of the disruption of our regular events because of the COVID-19
        situation, we have started OpenHack. OpenHack is a new initiative by NUS
        Hackers that aims to promote the spirit of hacking amongst students,
        encouraging students to contribute to existing open-source projects
        and/or create new (and fun!) open-source projects of your own. Non-NUS
        students are definitely welcome to participate in this challenge as
        well!
